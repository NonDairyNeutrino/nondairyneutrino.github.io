During my career, I've taught physics at a variety of levels.  The number of times I have taught a course is highlighted in parentheses after course title.

## Qualitative
- Physics 106: Physics Inquiry (1)
## Algebra-Based
- Physics 123: Physics for Life Science III (1)
## Calculus-Based
- Physics 182: Introductory Physics with Calculus (2)
## Upper-Level
I would especially love to teach advanced courses on Relativity and Computational Physics.
